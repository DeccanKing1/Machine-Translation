# Machine-Translation
English to French Translation using Recurrent Neural Network

# Introduction
In this notebook, a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline is built. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup
This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

# Udacity Workspaces (Recommended)
Udacity Workspaces provide remote connection to GPU-enabled instances right from the classroom. Refer to the classroom lesson for this project to find an overview of navigating & using Jupyter notebook Workspaces.

# Amazon Web Services (Optional)
Please refer to the Udacity instructions for setting up a GPU instance for this project, and refer to the project instructions in the classroom for setup. The recommended AMI should include compatible versions of all required software and libraries to complete the project. link for AIND students

# Install
Python 3
NumPy
TensorFlow 1.x
