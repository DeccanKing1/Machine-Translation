# Machine-Translation
English to French Translation using Recurrent Neural Network. 

# Introduction
In this notebook, a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline is built. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup
This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently.


# Install
Python 3
NumPy
TensorFlow 1.x
Keras 2.x
Submission
