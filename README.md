# Machine-Translation
English to French Translation using Recurrent Neural Networks. 

## Introduction
In this notebook, a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline is built. Completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

## Data:
You can download the data from data folder.

## Files Description:
machine_translation.ipynb: main ipython notebook describing the procesdure
machine_translation.html: html version of above ipython notebook
helper.py: includes functions for our project
README.md: read me file for he repository
data: data to be used for training and validation 

## Setup
